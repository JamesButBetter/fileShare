# Premise — We shouldn’t eat meat.

Ethically, meat is obscene, many points have been raised about this, from Benjamin Franklin, who called consumption of fish “unprovoked murder” — To Alex Hershaft who compared factory farming to his experience surviving the holocaust.

One reason that eating meat is ethically wrong is shown by our lack of any line to differ human rules from those of any other animal. One argument asks where there is no set of transactions that would make eating a human moral, we cannot expect to morally eat animals. The premise argues that if we applied attributes of a creature to a template human, say form, lifespan, or wisdom and suggested consumption of that animal, which positions people for hard choices as to what qualities would make them ethical to consume.

Some people alike to Christoper Cox, argue that the line lies with executive function, and ability to form goals. He argues p”unless there is reasonable doubt in the ability of oysters to feel”, there is no reason to avoid them. Oysters live mostly on plankton, at the base of the food chain, and also reduce water pollution when healthy, making the arguments for not consuming sustainably farmed oysters conflicted. 

In addition, meat is inefficient. Meat land use takes up eighty percent of food production land, only generating eighty three percent of our calories. Food production also remains our leading driver in biodiversity loss, and we could quarter food land use by cutting down meat in our diets.

Attenborough (2010), warned we p”cannot support billions” of consumers of the meat industry. Meats like beef take over one hundred times more land to produce a million calories compared to legumes and, sixty times as much land use for protein production. 

Forty three percent of cropland is used for animal feed, and cutting beef and sheep product, excluding dairy, would reduce its use by three hundred million hectors, also decrease pasture use by one billion hectors, almost halving our agriculture land use. Cutting all meat would remove all pasture use, helping restore biodiversity, and saving e thirty three percent global non-barren land for biodiversity, housing, or infrastructure. Overall, eating 

# Part two, what no stop

Cutting meat is not without it’s downsides. Meat is high in calorie and protein density. Also contains a much more complete profile of amino acids.

It has also been argued by some utilitarians, that animals life would likely not exist without human demand, it is ethical to eat meat that is sustainably farmed. They argue that as the animal would die anyway, we can kill. It does assume that natural things tend to be good.

# Conclusion

Brock et al. (2012) found that people who expected to eat meat later were more likely to justify cruel production of meat, and even even justified preferring worse welfare meat, like beef compared to venison, if they were likely to be soon eating it. 

Meat also has very high carbon emit, and decreasing pure meat cow herds to increase the benefit of meat. Sustainable hunted meat, like venison, is promising, but low supply and high demand would raise costs substantially, something humanity rarely agrees on.

Regardless of ethics, disconnect from our actions is antisocial as seen in Brock, and this presents a clear moral inconsistency. Plant based diets are also linked to lower heart issue and cancer rates.

Alike Plumwood (1993, 1996), point out cruelty as analogous to women rights movements, and anti racism. Anthropocentrism, he says is comparable to both, presenting unacceptable downsides.

Plato was one of the first to raise the land use argument in Athens, it’s increasingly clear now if we our current actions are either going to lead to animal cruelty, biodiversity damage, or both.

Moral disconnect sets concerning ideals that the writers of the enlightenment championed against, by lacking the resolve to stand up for things unethical, we venture towards obedience to norms that have betrayed ethics.

Antibiotic resistance increases when any farming is used, sixty percent diseases are animal born so meat farms increase risks of disease outbreaks that could cause mass disruption, by lowering animal numbers, reducing antibody use, infection risk lowers.

Crop production focusing on animal feed is a major barrier to reducing meat. Low cost corn and farmers political power makes it hard to pivot to alternatives. Plant processing may help with this, as it could keep single crop systems, while providing variation.

Man can’t relate. Ethical meat requires significant accountability. Systems to ensure this would likely be complex, but plausible if there was open tracing, and social norms properly reflected agreed ethical principles.

Laws on cruelty may help welfare, but pushing acceptance and land benefits could help bring about change as much as higher taxes on meat, cutting plant taxes, could possibly lead to healthier consumer options possibly driving change.

Overall, meat consumption remains, although morally questionable, personally opinions weak but humanity should probably figure out it’s ethical guidelines. Regardless, meat is more limited than population, so costs are high, and meat production continues to take up usable land. Meat also remains a notable embassy of climate change, which continues to risk human lives. Perhaps it is time to stop looking at the sky, and instead start looking at our own start, and wonder how we ended up where we are now.

Some problems, appear to not care much about us, and will resolve themselves regardless. It is my personal stance that this problem will resolve without much care for humanity, and as such, it must resolve this post haste, lest leave others, just to their eternal prolonged suffering.
